# Prediction-of-Engineering-Branch-Selection-for-B.Tech-Students-using-Python #
This project aims to predict the most suitable engineering branch for students based on their academic performance, entrance exam results, and personal preferences using Machine Learning algorithms in Python.The goal is to assist educational institutions and career counselors in guiding students toward the right specialization that aligns with their aptitude and skillset, ensuring improved academic performance and satisfaction in their chosen field.

**Technical Highlights**
🔹 Data Analysis & Preprocessing:

**->Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to understand feature distributions, correlations, and patterns in student data.**

**->Handled missing values, standardized scores, and performed feature encoding for categorical data.**

**->Split dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.**

🔹 Model Development

Implemented multiple ML algorithms including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier
